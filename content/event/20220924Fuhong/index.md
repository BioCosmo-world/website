"A Glimpse of Biotech" is a series focused on the biotech field, aimed at inviting practitioners from different stages of their career development and various process ends of the biotech industry chain to share their experiences and exchange insights from various perspectives, helping members interested in biotech development to understand career options, working conditions, and industry status, and to plan their career development path.

How do teams in enterprises develop innovative products, and how do they promote their products to the market? What challenges are encountered in the process of transforming scientific research results, and how should they be addressed? How can young scholars explore suitable career paths, and how should they make critical decisions at key points in their development? What are the differences in working environments between domestic and foreign biopharmaceutical companies, and how should one make a choice? What is the current situation and future development of the monoclonal antibody industry?

We are honored to invite Chairman and CEO [Zhang Wenjie](https://www.henlius.com/en/NewsDetails-3324-26.html) of [Henlius](https://www.henlius.com/en/Index.html) (Fuhong Hanlin) , who has launched 5 products in China and 1 product internationally, and opened a new chapter in which China's monoclonal antibody drugs benefit global patients. 

Mr. Zhang has nearly 30 years of experience in commercial operations and management in the pharmaceutical industry. After joining Fuhong Hanlin in 2019, he led the company to evolve from Biotech to Biopharma, and successfully promoted the smooth listing of core products such as Hanquyou®, Hanszhuang®, etc. Scholars and peers who are interested in job searching and innovative biopharmaceutical development in the pharmaceutical industry are welcome to participate in online exchanges and discuss with industry leaders!
