  What is the structure of a journal?
  What are the challenges of starting a journal?
  What is the current status of the development of independent Chinese journals?
  If a PhD student wants to pursue a career related to journals, what options are available and how can they prepare?

  For this less traveled career path of a biology PhD, we invited Dr. Ke Chen, one of the founders of "The Innovation" journal, who previously worked on cancer research at a research institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to share his exciting experience in helping Chinese scientists build their own authoritative academic journals.
