We have invited six front-line scientific researchers (bioinformatics, genetics, oncology, agriculture) and two BioCosmo moderators (microbiology, biotechnology) to discuss and share their "art" in scientific research! 

Topics include: How do you view the viewpoint in the book that "if a student working on research takes on the main responsibility for selecting the topic, he is more likely to succeed!" How do you view the two different experimental styles of "fast trial and error" and "careful preparation"?
