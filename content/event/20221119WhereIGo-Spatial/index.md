For our fifth event, we invited a young professor and a product manager to discuss the frontiers of spatial omics research and share interdisciplinary perspectives from academia and industry.

What is spatial omics? Spatial omics technology addresses the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and enables the reflection of spatial relationships between cells through gene expression data from individual cells, offering the possibility of tissue-level insights. Our guest for this event, Dr. Yanxiang Deng, recently published a paper in Science reporting a new spatially resolved epigenetic analysis technique he developed. This marks the first achievement in observing the epigenetic mechanisms of tissue development at the spatial and whole-genome levels, as well as mapping the spatial regulation of epigenetics associated with development and disease. This breakthrough has the potential to open up new avenues for treatment.

Guests: 
# Dr. Yanxiang Deng 
Dr. Yanxiang Deng received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). He is currently completing his postdoctoral research at Yale University in the Department of Biomedical Engineering with Prof. Rong Fan, and he will join University of Pennsylvania as an Assistant Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Yanxiang’s research is focused on the development and deployment of single-cell and spatial multi-omics profiling technologies, often based on microfabricated devices. He recently developed several novel spatial technologies, including spatial-CUT&Tag, spatial-ATAC-seq, and DBiT-seq, which may find wide-spread applications in developmental biology, cancer research, neuroscience, and immunobiology.

# Xiaoshan Wang 
Xiaoshan Wang is Sr Product Manager at Advanced Cell Diagnostics, a Bio-Techne Company heard quartered in Newark California, where he focuses on RNAscope™ clinical applications. With over 15 years in the biotechnology / clinical diagnostics field, Xiaoshan received his Master of Science degree in biomedical sciences from Virginia Tech, and his M.B.A. from University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business.
