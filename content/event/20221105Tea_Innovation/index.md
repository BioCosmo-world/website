Do you have a lot of ideas but no one to share them with?

Do you want to meet friends from different universities?

Are you willing to explore the truth through sharing and discussion?

Join the BioCosmo tea party and spark ideas together!

This Saturday, we will launch a brand new online event series - the BioCosmo tea party. The tea party will be an online chat room for small groups of about one hour. To ensure reliability and participation, the event will have a host but no set agenda. It is only open to community members, except for invited guests, and each session has a limited number of participants. Each session will have a freely discussed topic related to the life of biological research, and we are committed to expanding the channels of communication among biological researchers through the chat room, providing a platform for expressing views and helping everyone meet new friends.
