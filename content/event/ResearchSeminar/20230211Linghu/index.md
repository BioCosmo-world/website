The brain, unlike a computer that processes information using only electrical signals, uses a series of interacting biological signals to achieve its functions. These biological signals include ion concentrations, levels of molecular messengers, protein activities, gene expression dynamics, and other biophysical dynamics. They form signal transduction networks within cells, which, through complex interactions, enable biological computation and convert cellular signal inputs into cellular signal outputs. These interactions produce dynamic and harmonious biological signals, and some subtle deviations from this dynamic harmony often lead to brain disorders, resulting in cognitive, learning, and memory impairments. The various biological signals in the brain constitute a symphony of brain activity, and understanding the working mechanisms of the brain and the mechanisms of brain disorders requires the simultaneous observation and study of multiple biological signals, much like appreciating a symphony requires listening to the sounds of multiple instruments at the same time.

In this academic lecture, BioCosmo is fortunate to invite Professor [Changyang Linghu](https://bme.umich.edu/people/changyang-linghu/) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, to share a series of new techniques for observing biological signals in the brain. Don't miss out, everyone!
