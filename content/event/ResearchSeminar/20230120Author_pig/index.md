"Bringing back the dead" has been an eternal pursuit of humanity since ancient times. Stories about "bringing back the dead" are passed down in cultures from different systems around the world. With the development of technology and the popularization of science, people increasingly recognize that "reversing death" is a fantasy, and "bringing back the dead" has become a "legend."

However, a few months ago, Nenad Sestan's team at Yale University published a paper on "resurrecting" pigs, once again sparking public discussion about "bringing back the dead." So, does this mean that "bringing back the dead" can really be achieved? Will the resurrected pigs become the "zombie virus source" as depicted in science fiction movies?

In this issue of the BioCosmo Dialogue with First Authors column, we are fortunate to have one of the co-first authors of this paper, Shupei Zhang, to answer these questions for us.

"Shupei, can you tell us how you achieved 'bringing back the dead'?"

"Bringing back the dead? Let me personally dispel this illusion for you!"

Although the cell functions of the major organs were restored through OrganEx one hour after the death of the piglet, the piglet did not wake up, so it cannot be said that it was truly "brought back to life." Nevertheless, our research still revealed the recovery potential of the cells of large mammals after prolonged ischemia, and also laid an important foundation for rescuing patients with sudden cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in clinical practice.
