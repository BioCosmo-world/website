summary: Drawing and Application of Cell Atlas
abstract: 'The advent of single-cell sequencing technology has revolutionized our understanding of cellular diversity and has led to the creation of a comprehensive "cell atlas" that maps the molecular characteristics of individual cells. As such, the drawing and application of a cell atlas has become a crucial component of modern biological research.'
