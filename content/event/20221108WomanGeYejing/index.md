Professor Ge Yejing
Assistant Professor, Department of Cancer Biology, Division of Basic Science Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX

In this era of rapid technological development, female workers have become an indispensable force in society. Compared to traditional perceptions of women several decades ago, more and more women with independent thinking and idealism in today's society aspire to make achievements in their careers. However, faced with deeply rooted family role division concepts and invisible unfriendliness towards women in some job positions, how can we find our own direction and persist in it?

For this reason, BioCosmo has launched a "Dialogue with Female Scientists" series, aimed at understanding how female scientists from different backgrounds solve similar problems, and also hoping to provide more references for everyone's future scientific research paths. We are honored to have invited Professor Yejing Ge for an interview in the first issue.

Professor Yejing Ge is currently an assistant professor at the Anderson Cancer Center in the United States. Her laboratory is dedicated to researching the molecular mechanisms of skin stem cells and discovering treatments for diseases such as cancer and aging. Professor Ge graduated from the Department of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University in 2006 and earned her Ph.D. in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology from UIUC in 2012. She completed her postdoctoral training at Rockefeller University in the United States.

Looking back on her educational experience, Professor Ge mentioned that when she first arrived in the United States after graduating from college, language and culture were both major challenges for her. Rather than being anxious about the uncertainty of the future, it is better to seize everything at hand and do well with the things currently in one's hands. Many things will become clear with this approach.

Professor Ge suggests that when choosing one's research, it is best to be guided by one's own research interests. From being a student to becoming a laboratory director, Professor Ge believes that one must learn to constantly summarize, review, and learn from others. Summarizing one's current achievements, reviewing areas for improvement during the process, and learning from colleagues or predecessors at the same stage in their careers are all good habits for future development.

Moreover, in the current highly competitive environment, many things may not go as planned, and many things are determined by the environment and personal characteristics at the time. Therefore, there is no need to be overly anxious and one should learn to relax, enjoy the natural progress and setbacks of each stage.

## Conversation Topics

1. Many excellent female researchers face the difficult question of how to balance their career and love life. What advice does Professor Ge have for female researchers who are still single?
Many female researchers who are currently in school and at the early stages of their careers are single due to busy academic and work schedules. Professor Ge believes that single female researchers do not need to rush to find a partner. Continuously improving one's personal abilities and gaining self-affirmation and confidence are the real attractions to a partner.

2. After getting married, how can female researchers better balance their career and family relationships?
After getting married, facing the dual pressures of family and academics, sacrificing one's own academic work is not the only choice for women. Ideally, both partners can develop their careers. If a woman sacrifices her academic work for the family, she may find that being a homemaker is not an easy task. Therefore, both partners need to learn to adjust flexibly, set clear goals for their academics, and this can help balance the relationship between the two.

When both partners aspire to advance their careers, they can communicate with each other, collaborate, and clearly define their respective responsibilities in the family, and help each other. There is no standard answer to how to interact with one's partner in the family. It requires mutual communication and finding the best way that suits each individual. Some suggestions are to give partners some household chores, such as doing housework, which can help form a healthy pattern where both sides contribute to the family.

3. Despite the increasing attention to female researchers in academia, female researchers still face the phenomenon of being "labeled". What is Professor Ge's understanding of her identity as a "female researcher"?
In the face of emphasis on her identity as a female scientist, Professor Ge did not feel any additional pressure. Although 90-95% of her colleagues are male, a small number of colleagues sometimes feel that institutions have extra "care" for women. She believes that a truly equal environment should not be determined by gender, but should focus on science itself. Being in an era where female scientists are getting more and more attention is actually lucky. As a scientist, we should focus on improving our personal abilities

## Closing Remark 
-- Professor Ge has repeatedly emphasized the importance of balancing personal freedom with a focus on our own work in life. When we do our job well, gender will no longer be a factor that can determine our future.
