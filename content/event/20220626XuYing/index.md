The interdisciplinary field of mathematical biology aims to use mathematical tools to establish mechanisms or evolutionary models for some biological processes, help understand their principles, and provide explanations, making black boxes in complex life systems transparent and promoting the development of theoretical biology. Mathematical models can be used to understand and demonstrate cell proliferation, gene expression, and dynamic balance of various reactions in organisms in the field of biology.

In recent years, with the development of genomics and other omics technologies and computational biology, large-scale biological data analysis has become possible. At the same time, the demand for understanding complex systems has led to increasing attention to the application of mathematical models, which has promoted the research of extremely complex and nonlinear dynamic processes.

BioCosmo has the honor of inviting Professor [Xu Ying](https://www.bmb.uga.edu/directory/people/ying-xu) from the University of Georgia to unveil the mystery of mathematical biology and introduce how to use omics big data to explain some biological processes under pathological conditions.
