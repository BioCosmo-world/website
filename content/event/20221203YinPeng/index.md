Imaging technologies with higher resolution, greater convenience, and richer information dimensions have always been an important driving force for life science research. Professor Peng Yin's team at Harvard University has developed several DNA-based imaging and spatial omics technologies, such as the DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging technology, DNA-Exchange multicolor imaging technology, SABER in situ signal amplification technology, and LightSeq spatial sequencing technology, which have been widely applied in large-scale protein mapping studies and biomarker discovery in various tissues and diseases.

What are the frontier achievements of DNA nanotechnology in the fields of molecular imaging and spatial omics? What are the limitations and challenges in performance improvement? What are the potential applications waiting to be developed? Can it help in your research field? In this roundtable discussion, we are fortunate to invite Professor Peng Yin from Harvard University and dozens of top scientists from Zhejiang University and Peking University to share the latest developments in the field, their views on these issues, and their interpretations of macro development trends.

Part 1
DNA-based Imaging and Spatial Omics Lecture (25min)
Professor Peng Yin: Engineer DNA probes to advance bioimaging

Part 2
Roundtable discussion on the forefront of DNA imaging (45min)

What are the advantages and limitations of DNA-based imaging technology compared to other optical imaging technologies, and what are the most suitable application areas for biological research?
What are the performance improvements that can be further made in current microscopy imaging technologies? What is the maturity level of commercialization of such technologies, and what are their application scenarios?
How can one extensively explore knowledge from multiple fields during the doctoral and postdoctoral stages, and how can interdisciplinary collaborations be fostered during the independent PI stage? Are there any experiences or lessons for scientists in entrepreneurship?
