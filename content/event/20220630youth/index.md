Since its establishment, BioCosmo has been contacted by many students who are pursuing both undergraduate and graduate degrees in biology. Although we have not established a group specifically for these students due to our focus, as a community of over a thousand overseas biology PhD/postdoc scholars, we also hope to provide some experienced guidance for these students.

Starting from this event, we will launch the CosmoYouth series of events through the resources in our community. In this event, we have invited three outstanding members of our community to share their experiences with applying to biology PhD programs in the United States. We hope to help younger students avoid some pitfalls and get closer to their dream schools.

In this event, we invited three outstanding community members to share their experiences of applying to American biology PhD programs, hoping to help younger students avoid some detours and get closer to their dream schools. Guests: Yirui Hong (University of Pennsylvania), Ruifeng Sun (Yale University), and Chenlei Hu (Harvard University).
