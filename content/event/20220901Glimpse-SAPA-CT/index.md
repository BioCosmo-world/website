# Guests: 

## Wang Liqun 
Dr. Richard Wang （Liqun Wang）is the founder, chairman and CEO of Neukio Biotherapeutics. Bachelor of Cell Biology from University of Science and Technology of China, Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from University of Maryland, Baltimore, MBA from Xavier University, and postdoctoral fellow of National Institutes of Health (NIH). 

Dr. Wang has rich professional background and R&D management experience in the biopharmaceutical field in the United States and China. He used to be the VP and CTO of Fosun Pharma and the CEO of Fosun Kite, a joint venture between Fosun and Kite in the US. It took less than three years to complete technology transfer, clinical trial, and registration of Yescarta, becoming the first CAR-T product approved by the NMPA. Before that, he worked in important management positions at P&G Pharmaceuticals, BMS, AZ and GSK China R&D Center for nearly 20 years, participating in the R&D and transformation of many new drugs. Before joining Fosun Kite, Dr. Wang served as the COO of CBMG, overseeing the company's operations, production of cell therapy products, pharmacology and clinical research, and concurrently serving as the general manager of the Stem Cell Division.

## Dong Wang
Dong co-founded Enrich Therapeutics in 2018, and since then, leads the company as Board Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Enrich Therapeutics develops a novel cell discovery/isolation technology that enables a streamlined workflow of cell culturing, kinetics profiling, and guided capturing on a single platform. Dong received both B.S. and M.S. from University of Science and Technology Beijing and completed postgraduate training in Structural Biology in Cellular and Molecular Physiology Department at Yale University. 

Dong started his industry career in the life science sector as a bench scientist and gradually shifted to commercial management and leadership roles. Over the span of his 20-year career, Dong held various leadership positions in research, product, operation, and business development in five private and public companies. Prior to co-founding Enrich Therapeutics, Dong helped two biotech startups gain significant growth and led to successful exits for both businesses. Dong’s exceptional capability of strategic thinking and extensive experiences in both science and business make him a solid problem-solver and decision-maker in the biotech industry.
