As a researcher in the field of biomedicine abroad, you may consider returning to your home country for a teaching position as an important career development option, BUT 

U may not be familiar with the domestic research environment and development prospects. 
U may have doubts about when to return and which university to choose. 

.......

To help everyone find answers and promote academic exchanges and deep cooperation among outstanding young scholars at home and abroad, we have built a smooth and efficient talent exchange platform.

In this session of the BioCosmo academic sharing conference, we are honored to invite Professor Chen Chao, Professor Dong Zhuxin, and Professor Wu Xinyin to share their early career development experiences after returning to China.
