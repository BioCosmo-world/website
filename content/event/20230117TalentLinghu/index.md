The research direction of the research group is neuroscience and biotechnology. They develop and use innovative new technologies to observe and decode transient signals, computations, long-term changes, and multimodal dynamics in the brain. The research group has published multiple papers in journals such as Cell, Nature Biotechnology, and Neuron. The research group is affiliated with the top-ranked University of Michigan Medical School, Neuroscience Institute, Life Sciences Program, and College of Engineering. They explore and understand brain function and principles with the advantages of interdisciplinary and cutting-edge research facilities. The research group provides comprehensive training in academic skills, and the college offers perfect career planning and development programs to help members of the research group obtain independent academic positions and industrial positions. Applicants with relevant backgrounds (including but not limited to molecular biology, bioengineering, optical imaging, neuroscience, cell biology, and biophysical chemistry) are welcome to join.

The research group members will develop or apply breakthrough technologies to observe and decode transient signals, long-term changes, or multimodal dynamics of cell populations in the living brain. Research group members will also collaborate with top scientists and engineers in the fields of molecular and cellular biology, neuroscience, microscopy, genetics, developmental biology, microfluidics, and computational analysis and modeling at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in a multidisciplinary environment.
