  Plant growth is not always smooth sailing. Throughout their short or long lifetimes, plants encounter various types of microorganisms, some of which are beneficial and some are pathogenic. These microorganisms pose significant challenges to the plant's immune system. As a result, plants have evolved a series of induced defense mechanisms against pathogen attacks. What are the molecular mechanisms underlying these defense mechanisms, and what are their important applications?

  BioCosmo is honored to invite Professor [Xinian Dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinnian_Dong), one of the most authoritative experts in the field of plant disease resistance, and an academician of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, to give a talk on "Plant Immunity" as the second speaker in the Life Sciences Pioneer Series and to share the latest advances in the field of plant biology.
