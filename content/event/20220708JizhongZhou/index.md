  Microbial ecology involves the study of microorganisms and their relationships with the environment and with each other. Microbes drive many essential processes for ecosystem functioning, production, and sustainability, while environmental changes also shape microbial communities.

  With the continuous development of microbial metagenomics in recent years, how can we use new technologies to study this field and what are the new advances in this area?

  BioCosmo is honored to invite Professor [Ji-Zhong Zhou](https://www.ou.edu/cas/mpbio/people/faculty/zhou), a research professor at the University of Oklahoma, director of the Environmental Genomics Research Center, senior visiting scientist in Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a specially appointed professor at the School of Environment at Tsinghua University, to share his scientific research journey and give an academic lecture on "Microbial Ecology and Genomic Technology."
