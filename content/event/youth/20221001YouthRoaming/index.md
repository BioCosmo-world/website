The first weekend of October
in New Haven
welcomed our community's first offline event!

Seven buddies from different regions and majors in North America
What memories did they leave at Yale University?

Youth Odyssey | Cosmo-V Series:
This series aims to create an opportunity for BioCosmo community members to have offline academic exchanges and explore different cities, helping them meet new friends and unlock new experiences. During the event, we will invite members from the host university or research institution within the community to act as hosts, taking everyone on a deep tour of the campus and the unique local attractions, and organizing academic sharing and discussions for the community members to create exclusive memories for BioCosmo.

Where would you like to go for the next stop? 
Want to become a host and show everyone around?
